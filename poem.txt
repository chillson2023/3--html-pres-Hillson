Playing baseball with my teammates never gets old, 
We play our hardest, we play bold, 
Pitcher hurls a strike,
The bat makes a whack, 
It was hit so high,
As high as the sky,
Teammates yell, “Get back!”
The smack of the leather, 
Sure made a thump, 
But what was the call of the ump?
“Safe!”
The cheers of the parents, 
They all say “yay!”
For tomorrow is the Championship Day!
